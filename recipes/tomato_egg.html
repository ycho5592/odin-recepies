                In a bowl, mix Sauce ingredients and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, crack your eggs and add sesame oil. Beat the eggs & sesame
                oil for 20-30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a pan set on medium heat, add 1 tsp of oil. Once oil is hot, add beaten eggs.
                Cook by sitrring and folding in the edges until eggs take shape and glossy in the
                center. Remove them from the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Back into the pan, add oil and green onions. Cook for 5 seconds or until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add tomatoes and water. Allow the tomatoes to cook for 2-3 minutes until they have
                softened, and skin begins to peel away.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour sauce over tomatoes. Allow sauce to simmer & thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once slightly thicker, add eggs and gently fold them into the sauce and tomatoes. 
                Remove from heat. Serve & enjoy. Optional: garnish with more green onions.
