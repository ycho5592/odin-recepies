                Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat 
                until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and 
                water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian 
                seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>

                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
                boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of 
                the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan 
                cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or 
                make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>

                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an 
                additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
